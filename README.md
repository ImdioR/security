# Security Vulnerability Disclosure @ Centrifuge
No technology is perfect or perfectly secure. Centrifuge believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying weaknesses in any technology. We welcome the contribution of external security researchers and look forward to awarding them for their invaluable contribution to the security of all our users.

If you believe you've found a security issue in our product or service, we encourage you to notify us. The disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of our users and we will reward valid, in-scope submissions with a bounty.

Please refer to the Centrifuge [_Security Vulnerability Disclosure_ page](https://centrifuge.io/security) for further information on how to disclose any vulnerablity you might find.
